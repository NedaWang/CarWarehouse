## 1. Layout 
A layout defines the structure for a user interface in your app. 
All elements in the layout are built using a hierarchy of View and ViewGroup objects. 
A View usually draws something the user can see and interact with. 
Whereas a ViewGroup is an invisible container that defines the layout structure for View and other ViewGroup objects. 
ViewGroup is a special View.
